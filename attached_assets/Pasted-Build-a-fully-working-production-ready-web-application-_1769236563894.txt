Build a fully working production-ready web application inspired by https://thelifecalendar.com
, but instead of a life calendar, it generates a living generative-art wallpaper based on digits of π.

🎯 Core Concept

This is a global evolving artwork

Each new user signup adds exactly ONE new digit of π

That digit permanently adds one new stroke / chord / line to the artwork

The artwork is cumulative and identical for all users

The wallpaper updates daily for existing users

The visual style must closely match circular Circos-style generative artwork, with dense colorful chords on a black background.

Artwork credit text must appear on the site:

“With thanks to Martin Krzywinski and Cristian Ilies Vasile — cool visualisers of Pi.”

🧱 TECH STACK (MANDATORY)
Frontend

Next.js (App Router)

Tailwind CSS

Minimalist design (black background, elegant typography)

Mobile-first

Backend

Node.js (API routes)

PostgreSQL (or SQLite if needed)

Cron job for daily rendering

Image Generation

Use Node Canvas OR Python (Pillow / Cairo) via server-side script

Generate static PNG wallpapers

🧠 DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

Create tables:

users

id

created_at

country (optional)

pi_state

total_users

last_pi_digit_index

last_rendered_at

Rules:

Each new signup increments total_users

Each signup unlocks exactly one digit of π

π digits are read sequentially from a stored file

🧮 PI DIGITS

Store at least 1 million digits of π locally in the project

Never fetch π from an external API

Digits are deterministic and never change

🎨 ART GENERATION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
Visual Style

Black background

Circular layout

Dense overlapping colorful chords

Neon / spectral color palette

Closely resemble Circos-style generative art

Mapping Logic

For each π digit:

Digit (0–9) determines:

Angle on circle

Radius range

Color from fixed palette

Chord connection point

Rules:

Artwork must be deterministic

Same number of users → same image

New digit adds ONE new line only

No redraw or randomness per render

📱 WALLPAPER SUPPORT (ALL IPHONES)

Generate wallpapers in multiple resolutions:

1170×2532

1290×2796

1125×2436

750×1334

Center artwork safely (no clipping by notch or island).

Expose endpoints like:

/wallpaper/1170x2532.png
/wallpaper/latest.png

⏰ UPDATE LOGIC
New User

Immediately receives latest global artwork

Existing Users

Wallpaper updates daily at 6:00 PM local time

Use iPhone Shortcuts to fetch updated image

Server

Cron job runs at 5:55 PM IST

Renders fresh wallpapers based on total users

📲 IPHONE SHORTCUT SUPPORT

Create a dedicated page explaining how to:

Install a Shortcut

Fetch wallpaper from URL

Auto-update wallpaper daily at 6 PM

No App Store app required.

🌍 LANDING PAGE REQUIREMENTS

Design similar to Life Calendar:

Large hero text

Live counter:

“Digits of π unlocked: 18,492”

Explanation:

One signup = one digit

Wallpaper evolves globally

CTA:

“Add your digit to π”

After signup, show:

“You just added digit #XXXXX of π.”

🧠 PERFORMANCE & COST

Optimize for low-cost hosting

Cache rendered images

Never regenerate unless user count increases

🚀 DELIVERABLES

The final output must include:

Fully working website

Signup flow

Generative art engine

Daily wallpaper update system

iPhone Shortcut instructions page

Proper credits to artists

Clean, readable, commented code

❌ DO NOT

Do not use external paid APIs

Do not generate random art per user

Do not require mobile apps

Do not simplify visuals into basic shapes

This project must feel poetic, mathematical, and timeless.
Treat it as internet art, not just a website.
