PHASE 0 — CANVAS & BASE CIRCLE (0 USERS)
Step 0.1 — Canvas

Create a square canvas

Background color: pure black

Center point = (cx, cy)

Radius R = 40–45% of canvas width

No chords yet. No chaos yet. Just structure.

Step 0.2 — Divide Circle into 10 Sections (Digits 0–9)

This is CRITICAL.

Split the circle into 10 equal angular segments

Each segment corresponds to one digit of π

Each segment covers:

360° / 10 = 36°

Digit	Angle Range
0	0° – 36°
1	36° – 72°
2	72° – 108°
…	…
9	324° – 360°

This ring never changes, even if users increase.

Step 0.3 — Assign Fixed Colors (IMPORTANT)

Each digit gets one fixed color (Circos style: neon, spectral, scientific).

Example palette (can be refined later):

0 → cyan
1 → teal
2 → green
3 → yellow
4 → orange
5 → red
6 → magenta
7 → violet
8 → blue
9 → turquoise


Rules:

Color is digit-based, NOT random

Same digit → same color forever

This matches Krzywinski’s philosophy

At 0 users, show:

Outer ring

Colored arc sections only

No inner lines

This is the “silent universe”.

PHASE 1 — PI DIGITS AS CONNECTIONS (USERS BEGIN)

Now the magic starts.

Step 1.1 — Read π as a Digit Stream

Use π digits as:

3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3 2 3 8 4 ...


Each pair of digits defines one chord.

PHASE 2 — USER → CHORD MAPPING (CORE RULE)
Rule (LOCK THIS 🔒)

Each new user draws exactly ONE chord
using the NEXT TWO digits of π

User #	π digits	Chord
User 1	3 → 1	connect digit 3 to digit 1
User 2	1 → 4	connect digit 1 to digit 4
User 3	4 → 1	connect digit 4 to digit 1
User 4	1 → 5	connect digit 1 to digit 5
…	…	…

This is deterministic, irreversible, cumulative.

PHASE 3 — HOW TO DRAW ONE CHORD (VERY IMPORTANT)

For each chord:

Step 3.1 — Pick Start & End Angles

For digit d:

angle = center of digit’s 36° segment


Example:

digit 3 → angle = 3 × 36° + 18°
digit 1 → angle = 1 × 36° + 18°

Step 3.2 — Convert Angle → Point on Circle

Use:

x = cx + R × cos(angle)
y = cy + R × sin(angle)


This gives:

Start point

End point

Step 3.3 — Draw Chord (Straight, Clean)

Draw a straight line between the two points

Stroke width: thin (0.5–1.2px)

Opacity: low (0.2–0.4)

Why?

Dense beauty comes from accumulation, not thickness.

Step 3.4 — Color Logic

Use color of the START digit

OR gradient from start digit → end digit

Both are Circos-valid.

PHASE 4 — SCALE TO MANY USERS (THE CHAOS)

As users increase:

Chords overlap

Patterns emerge

Dense regions appear naturally

Pi’s hidden structure becomes visible

No randomness.
No decoration.
Just math + time + people.

This is exactly how Circos art feels alive.

PHASE 5 — DAILY UPDATE BEHAVIOR

Store total user count N

Use π digits up to 2N

Render image once per day

Save as static wallpaper

Everyone sees the same state

PHASE 6 — WHY THIS MATCHES MARTIN KRZYWINSKI STYLE

This follows his core principles:

Deterministic mapping

Circular symmetry

Color = meaning

Density from data, not effects

Beauty emerges from constraints

You’re not copying artwork —
you’re following the same grammar.

🧪 HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS TO REPLIT (IMPORTANT)

Tell Replit:

“Do NOT generate art creatively.
Follow the mathematical steps strictly.
The beauty must emerge from accumulation.”

If Replit understands this logic, code becomes trivial.
